            <h1>About The Minimalist Hiker</h1>
            <p>
                The Minimalist Hiker is here to help anyone feeling a bit overwhelmed at the idea of going alone at the discovery of the Chinese countryside. 
                It is for the person who wants to escape Shanghai for a day, a weekend or longer to spend more time in nature. 
                It is for everyone longing to walk through forests, climb mountains, swim in wild rivers or walk barefoot in the sand by the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here you can find a compilation of hiking or biking adventures that can be planned easily. 
                All information needed are made available in one spot, so that you don’t have to spend hours doing research on finding the best places to go and figuring out all the logistics to get there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of creating this blog came when I realized that so many people wanted to explore the wild places outside of Shanghai, but just did not know how to do it. 
                After each of my trip, I was receiving questions about how I discovered the location, how I went there, where I stayed… 
                It took me a few years to be fully comfortable with my travel planning skills in China. So today, I want to share everything I have learnt to make your exploration process as simple as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main mission of The Minimalist Hiker is to inspire anyone to spend more time outdoor.
