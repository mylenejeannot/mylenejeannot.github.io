                <p>
                    In late February, I had the chance to escape the cold of Shanghai for the nice spring 
                    weather of Hong Kong during my company’s annual team building. Always happy to 
                    spend more time in this amazing city, I decided to stay over the weekend and 
                    explore a few of the great trails that Hong Kong had to offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Friday mid-afternoon, after finishing all my meetings, I headed with one of my 
                    coworker towards Mount Johnston for what we thought would be a nice little stroll 
                    by the sea. Little did we know that this trail was actually quite a serious one with 
                    some pretty technical parts, for our greatest pleasure!
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_4big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_4.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="landscape"></a>
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_5big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_5.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="portrait"></a>
                </div>

                <p>
                    After coming out of the subway station, it took us some time to find the start of the 
                    hike, which was hidden in between two tiny yellow buildings, behind a fence that we 
                    had to climb over. Thankfully, a friendly street sweeper was taking his break there 
                    and showed us the right access point.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_6big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_6.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="portrait"></a>
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_7big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_7.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="portrait"></a>
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_8big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_8.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="portrait"></a>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Once on the path, it was all the way up towards the summit. The climb was not long, 
                    but quite strenuous with a very steep slope. Some parts had ropes installed to help 
                    going up, even though it was not always necessary. There were few forks on the 
                    way, but as long as we were going up, we could not get lost. After about 20min of 
                    constant uphill, we reached the top and were rewarded by fantastic views of Lama 
                    Island and the South China Sea.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_9big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_9.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="landscape"></a>
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_10big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_10.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="portrait"></a>
                </div>

                <p>
                    When continuing further on the ridge, we finally caught our first glimpse of Ap Lei
                    Pai, a small island connected to Mount Johnston by a thin sandbar, also known as
                    tombolo. The landscape was stunning with the blue sky, several boats cruising
                    around and birds flying close to us. We stopped for a while to take some pictures,
                    breath the fresh air and just enjoy this magical environment.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_11big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_11.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="landscape"></a>
                </div>

                <p>
                    After that, the scary way downhill started towards the sandbar. It was very rocky 
                    and slippery. We slowly descended, trying our best to keep our balance and not to 
                    fall. We did not have proper hiking shoes and were carrying our full backpack with 
                    work computer and traveling clothes. It was definitely not the best idea in the world, 
                    but sometimes, you just have to do with what you have.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_12big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_12.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="landscape"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    After making it safely to the tombolo, we enjoyed a nice break and dipped our foot in 
                    the water. My coworker went searching for some seashells to bring back to his 
                    daughter, while I was enjoying the refreshing seawater. The atmosphere was 
                    peaceful, even though a few trashes were scattered over the little beach, brought 
                    there by the ocean.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_14big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_14.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="landscape"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    The trail was continuing further on Ap Lei Pai and it was supposed to have a very
                    unique tidal pool at the end. However, the sun was already starting to be quite low
                    over the horizon, so we decided to head back. We had two options: to take 
                    the same path uphill or go around Mount Johnston, towards the left when facing it from the sandbar. 
                    We chose the second alternative.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_16big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_16.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="landscape"></a>
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_17big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_17.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="portrait"></a>
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_18big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_18.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="portrait"></a>
                </div>

                <p>
                    From there, the serious things started! The alternative path was mainly on rocks 
                    and involved lots of scrambling, ladders climbing and walking on thin edges above 
                    vertical drops leading directly to the sea or stones at the bottom. It definitely 
                    required a bit of skills to get through it. However, 
                    several planks, ropes and anchors were installed to make things easier. The scenery 
                    was absolutely breathtaking and we frequently stopped to admire it.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_19big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_19.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="landscape"></a>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    On the way, we found a rusted chair facing the ocean. It seemed to have been posted 
                    there for years. Of course, I could not resist the wish to go sit on it and get a great 
                    shot. We also met two guys practicing rock climbing on one of the stonewalls with 
                    the sunset in the background. Definitely not a bad spot!
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post3/big_pictures/post3_20big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post3/post3_20.jpg" alt="Mount Johnston picture" class="landscape"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    After all these thrilling adventures, without much transition, we reached again the
                    city and were greeted by a few high-rise buildings. From there, we just had to walk a
                    little over one kilometer to reach the nearest subway station and go in search of our
                    delicious dinner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, it was a very short hike, but it took us more than two hours to complete it,
                    with all the breaks we had, just to take it all in and appreciate the moment.
                </p>

            </section>

            <section class="detailed_information">
                <h2>Pros</h2>
                <p>
                    I highly recommend this hike for anyone who just has a few hours to spend hiking
                    and can’t dedicate a full day to it. It is very easily accessible by subway or by bus and
                    can be completed in less than two hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the scenery is absolutely stunning and quite unique with this beautiful
                    tombolo connecting the tiny island of Ap Lei Pai.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, this trail is very fun if you are an experienced hiker and enjoy a bit of a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2 class="middle_title">Cons</h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, this path is quite technical. It requires a little bit of skills to get
                    through certain parts and can be difficult for anyone not used to hiking in difficult
                    terrains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are scared of height, it is not recommended to go around Mount Johnston on
                    the way back, but rather to use the same trail to return.
                </p>
