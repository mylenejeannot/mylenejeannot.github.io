                </div>

                <p>
                    In early January, after a few very inactive days spent recovering from COVID and binge watching Christmas movies, I decided that the best way to start the new year was to be active, 
                    out in the countryside. Still feeling a bit weak and tired from my recent sickness, I chose to go with an easy day-hike around Shanghai. Several of my friends, all post-COVID, 
                    were also excited about this idea. On this early Monday morning, we were five people meeting at the train station, ready to get back a bit of movement in our life and to reconnect with nature. 
                    We were heading for Wuxi and the Junzhang ancient road.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following a 40min train ride and 50 more minutes on a bus, we were at the start of the trail. 
                    The weather was grey and a bit cold, but we were happy to be outside and looking forward to seeing what this path had to offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hike began in a very well maintained area with some man-made ponds and paved roads. However, 
                    it quickly got a bit wilder with mud paths covered of fallen leaves, winding through the forest. This was exactly what we wanted!
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post2/big_pictures/post2_4big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post2/post2_4.png" alt="Junzhang Ancient Road picture" class="portrait"></a>
                    <a href="../images/posts/post2/big_pictures/post2_5big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post2/post2_5.png" alt="Junzhang Ancient Road picture" class="portrait"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    After a short uphill of only 100m-elevation gain, it was mainly flat and easy for the next six kilometers. We were able to catch a sight of the lake Tai, but overall this trail did not have many views. 
                    It was more about being fully immersed in nature. Most of the first half was in the middle of the woods, crossing from time to time a few tombs or some gardens where local people were growing fruits, 
                    nuts and vegetables. We did not meet anyone, except for one off-road motorcycle having fun on the trail.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post2/big_pictures/post2_7big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post2/post2_7.png" alt="Junzhang Ancient Road picture" class="landscape"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    At about mid-point, after walking on the side of some nice tea fields, we arrived in a small village made of a few huge mansions looking mostly empty. 
                    There was also a little reservoir and we decided to have lunch by the water. Due to the fear of COVID, 
                    the locals were not very welcoming, but we were able to find a little spot by the side of the road to enjoy our picnic, without bothering anyone.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post2/big_pictures/post2_9big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post2/post2_9.png" alt="Junzhang Ancient Road picture" class="landscape"></a>
                    <a href="../images/posts/post2/big_pictures/post2_10big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post2/post2_10.png" alt="Junzhang Ancient Road picture" class="landscape"></a>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Once our bellies were full, we kept going, following the road around the small lake for a short while, before turning into a new mud-path for about one kilometer. 
                    We then ended up on a small road again, close to a newly-build village and going along an organic farm, according to the sign. 
                    We were quite interested by this plantation and wanted to go have a look and ask some questions. Once again, the locals rejected us quite rudely. 
                    COVID really destroyed the nice welcoming feel that used to be everywhere in China. 
                    Nowadays, people in remote areas are scared to catch the virus each time they see a stranger coming from the big cities. Without taking too much offense about it, 
                    we continued on our way. A few more meters and we were back on the trail. We crossed several nice abandoned buildings and a beautiful black and white rooster. 
                    Following a short but intense uphill, we reached an old circular concrete container with a romantic message on it: 你是我最爱的人，在此相遇一生 路记 (you are my favorite person, 
                    let’s meet here for a lifetime to remember). Of course, we had to organize a little group picture there!
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post2/big_pictures/post2_11big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post2/post2_11.png" alt="Junzhang Ancient Road picture" class="portrait"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    At the bottom of this hill, we were again on the pavement. There were quite a few road crossings on this hike. However, it was not too bothering, 
                    since each time it was only for a very short distance. In addition, there was not much traffic, at least on this cold winter day.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post2/big_pictures/post2_13big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post2/post2_13.png" alt="Junzhang Ancient Road picture" class="portrait"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Then, the big climb of the trail finally came up, with a bit more than 230m-elevation gain to conquer in the middle of an oak forest. 
                    In about 20min, we were able to reach the top, where a nice little meadow surrounded by old walls was waiting for us. After that, 
                    it was mainly downhill all the way. The path became narrower and wilder alternating between bamboo and different types of trees. 
                    One part was particularly interesting with all trees covered by some dried plants falling from the branches. It gave a very mystic impression to the entire area.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    After about 8.5h of walking, we made it to the end point. We were feeling exhausted, but our minds were refreshed and happy. 
                    We ended in a small village and got lucky enough to find a bus taking us directly to the train station without any transfer. 
                    On top of that, the timing was perfect! The bus came just as we were reaching the stop. It took us a bit more than one hour to get back to Wuxi station. 
                    All the train tickets around 6pm were sold out, so we had to book a later train and spent 60min waiting, while enjoying some well-deserved snacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This concluded the fantastic day I had just spent in nature with friends. I could not ask for a better way to start 2023!

            <section class="detailed_information">
                <h2>Pros</h2>
                <p>
                    I highly recommend this hike for anyone who wants a simple day spent outside in nature. It does not require much planning and can be done in one day without rushing through it. The access from Shanghai is incredibly easy and convenient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, despite being so close to the city of Wuxi, you truly feel fully immersed in the countryside without any city views or noises. It is also quite diverse in term of scenery, with forest, agricultural areas, tea fields, 
                    bamboos and abandoned buildings found along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, this trail is relatively easy and suitable for almost anyone. It is not short, with 15km to complete, but does not have many strenuous climbs or downhill.
                </p>
                <h2 class="middle_title">Cons</h2>
                <p>
                    This section of Junzhang ancient road does not have many open views to enjoy during the walk. Even when reaching the top of the view hills met on the way, the landscape is mostly blocked with trees and bushes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A total of five road crossings are present on this path. For some of them, it is needed to walk along the pavement for a few hundred meters.
