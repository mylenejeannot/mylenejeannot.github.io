                <p>
                    On a beautiful December Sunday, after all the COVID madness suddenly ended, I decided to celebrate my newly found freedom with a little hike in the hills. 
                    The weather was perfect to spend the day outside, sunny and dry! After several months stuck in Shanghai and two consecutive weekends of being in lockdown at home, 
                    I wanted something easy and decided to go check what Wuxi had to offer in terms of forest and lake views.</p>
                <p>
                    On this early crisp morning, walking in the streets of Shanghai with my bright colors hiking clothes and heavy boots, I was finally feeling like I was going where I belong: nature! 
                    I met with my friend at 7:30am to take the 40min high-speed train to Wuxi. From there, we had two options. We could take a quick subway ride to the beginning of the hike or we could enjoy a slower pace bus journey. 
                    Since none of us had been to Wuxi before, we opted for the bus to get a small glimpse of the city. It also allowed us to have a first look at Huishan, that we were planning to climb on that day.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post1">

                <p>
                    To access Huishan, we just had to get up some small unpretentious stairs on the side of the road, taking us straight to the hills. It seemed that several people had the same idea and we were all heading deeper into the forest. 
                    The path was clear and easy to follow. The first climb started quite fast, taking our breath away and forcing us to take a few stops, enjoying the moment, before reaching the top. It was not too strenuous, with only 330m-elevation gain, 
                    but it was enough to warm us up and make us remove a few layers. We quickly discovered the endless possibilities of hiking routes, making Huishan perfect for anyone. We could choose to make our hike as easy or as difficult as we wanted it. 
                    We opted for a harder and more off the beaten path trail, which took us directly all the way down on a very narrow and steep dirt path. This time, we were mainly alone in the woods, feeling fully immersed in nature while the city was still so close to us. 
                    It was really amazing!
                </p>

                <p>
                    We continued to follow the GPS mark that I had found on Liangbulu for a few more hours. It took us on some nice side tracks at the bottom of the mountain where we enjoyed the colorful leaves fallen on the ground. After that, we started going back all the way up again, 
                    wandering around some more touristy parts of Huishan, close to the old town. A few buildings, some magnificent yellow gingko and many small red Japanese maple trees were there to enjoy.

                <p>
                    After 3h of walking, we found an old temple with several tables placed in the courtyard hidden from the wind and a small shop selling drinks and snacks. We decided to stop there for lunch. 
                    There was also a few old gym equipment on the side and several super fit grandpas exercising and showing off their muscular bodies by removing their T-shirts, while we were wearing all of our layers trying to warm up. 
                    It was quite a sight! We enjoyed a nice rest, eating the food we brought from Shanghai and getting some sweet drinks from the shop, while discussing about the healthy lifestyle of the Wuxi’s locals. So many people were walking the paths of this little hill in the middle of the city, 
                    but at the same time it didn’t feel crowded at all. We also saw quite a few very impressive trail runners jumping from stone to stone or speeding down the slopes. It was a really nice feeling to be part of this active community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rested and with full bellies, we went back up on our way. Once again, after finally reaching the top, the trail took us all the way down on a slippery path. From there, we arrived in the middle of an old cemetery where the track was not as clear. 
                    Together with a few locals, we were all checking our GPS location, trying to find the way in between the tombs. It was quite a fun exploration and after a few wrong turns, we were finally back on track for a new climb to the top. The trail was more rocky and raw, 
                    making it quite fun to walk. From this side, we could also enjoy some city views of Wuxi, while still feeling fully immersed in nature. It was a great contrast!
                </p>

                    Once on top of Huishan, for the third time today and with around 1000m elevation gain done since the morning, we realized that the route I had chosen was quite ambitious and probably done by one of these crazy trail runners. 
                    We were way behind schedule and would not be able to close the 20km loop before the sky turned dark, especially since the selected road would be taking us up and down a couple more times. However, thanks to the many different trails available, 
                    we had nothing to worry about. We just chose to go for alternative path leading us to the other side of the mountain, while staying on top. This track was fully paved and a bit more crowded, but we enjoyed its easiness and flat grounds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the city views, this time, we were rewarded by the fantastic sight of the lake Tai, just when the light was at its best. We stopped for a few pictures and decided that we were completely satisfied with the hike and were ready to head back to Shanghai for a good rest. 
                    We went down for the last time today, following a beautiful wild trail and enjoying the perfect lighting in the sky.

                <p>
                    At the bottom, without any transition, we were once again in the city. The train station being quite close and us being tired and cold after this full day in nature, we opted to call a taxi instead of taking public transportation. 
                    We booked our train tickets back to Shanghai while comfortably seating in the warmth of the car, extremely satisfied about the amazing time we just had out in the woods.

                <h2>Pros</h2>
                <p>
                    I highly recommend this hike for a simple day outside in nature. Its ease of access from Shanghai makes it possible to head to Huishan without much planning and be immersed in nature 2h after leaving your front door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The endless options of hiking trails are suitable for every fitness levels. It is possible to stick only to the paved routes and go for an easy stroll in the forest. 
                    For the more adventurous and experienced people, many side mud paths are there to explore, taking you up and down the hill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, since Huishan is in the middle of the city, it is very easy to stop the hike wherever you want. When feeling tired, you just have to go down and you will find a road not far to head back to the train station.
                </p>
                <h2 class="middle_title">Cons</h2>
                <p>
                    Huishan is a hill in the middle of Wuxi, so you will not feel like you are completely in the wild. In some places, you can still hear the sounds of the cars. When the views are open, you will see highways and high-rise buildings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During rainy weather, it is not recommended to get down the dirt trails as they are quite steep and could end up being very slippery.
                </p>

                    <p>Following is the map of the trail, including details of the alternative path we took to shorten the hike a bit (taken from Liangbulu app 两步路). 
                        The full loop is 20km, with a total elevation gain of 1400m. Our shorter version is 12km long, with a total elevation of about 1000m.</p>

                    <p>Finally, here is a map of Wuxi showing the location of the end of the trail, for our shorter version (taken from Gaode map 高德地图). 
                        The full version of the hike is a loop, so starting and ending points are the same.
