                <p>
                    On a sunny Saturday morning in Hong Kong, I met with an old hiking friend from Shanghai. We decided to go for an easy, but beautiful walk: Dragon’s Back. 
                    This is one of the most popular trails in the city, due to its fantastic coastal views, while requiring not much effort to get there. 
                    It was a very easy hike, without steep incline and no technical skills needed.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post4/big_pictures/post4_4big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post4/post4_4.jpg" alt="Dragon's Back picture" class="landscape"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    We met at Chai Wan subway station. From there, we walked the two kilometers leading to the entrance of the path. 
                    This part was not the most enjoyable, along the relatively busy Cape Collison Road. 
                    However, we could catch a few glimpses of the impressive cemeteries of the area, built on the hillsides. 
                    After turning on Shek O Road, some stairs led us to the beginning of the hike. Finally, we were getting deeper into nature, 
                    enjoying the shadow of the surrounding trees and the fresh breath from the wind.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post4/big_pictures/post4_6big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post4/post4_6.jpg" alt="Dragon's Back picture" class="portrait"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    The trail quickly transformed into a mud path winding through the forest, with some rocky bits and a few tiny waterfalls here and there. 
                    It did not have many open views, but it was a nice way to slowly begin the hike. 
                    Being the weekend, it was a bit crowded with many hikers, both locals and tourists, but it did not impact the amazing experience of being outside.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post4/big_pictures/post4_8big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post4/post4_8.jpg" alt="Dragon's Back picture" class="portrait"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    After a bit more than one kilometer, a wooden sign indicated to turn left, in order to start the climb to the Dragon’s Back. 
                    It was not a tough ascend and was completed within 15min. Following this small stretch, we were on the ridge! 
                    From there, the views opened up to display on the left side, the fantastic coastline of Big Wave Bay and Shek O. 
                    On the right, we could admire the blue water from Tai Tam Bay and, further away, the Stanley Peninsula.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">

                <p>
                    Walking along the spine of the Dragon’s mountain was definitely the highlight of the hike, with so many viewpoints scattered along the way. 
                    It ended in an area made of big rocks, where we could climb a bit higher to catch even better views of the entire region.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once we were done admiring the beauty of this part of Hong Kong Island, we slowly made our way down, back to Shek O Road. 
                    The path was nice, alternating between muddy and rocky sections, with some stairs in between. 
                    A few more vantage points were found along the trail, to enjoy one last sight of Tai Tam Bay.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Once we reached the concrete road, a bus stop was right there to take us back directly to the city, if we wanted to. 
                    The accessibility of the trails is absolutely one of the great advantages of hiking in Hong Kong.

                <p>
                    Wanting to make the most out of this day, we decided not to stop here. 
                    Instead, we went for lunch in the small fishermen village of Shek O. A mini-bus took us there in less than 20min. 
                    Once arrived in the little town, we first enjoyed a quick walk to the beach, which was not too crowded at this time of the year. 
                    From there, we moved on to select a small hidden restaurant in one of the alleys of Shek O, where we savored a simple meal made of soup noodles with a few toppings.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post4/big_pictures/post4_18big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post4/post4_18.jpg" alt="Shek O picture" class="landscape"></a>

                </div>
                
                <p>
                    Finally, we concluded this time outdoor with the exploration of the small islet of Tai Tau Chau, accessible from the village by crossing the Shek O Lovers Bridge. 
                    It was a leisurely stroll of 2.5km with amazing sea views. The main way was paved, but some little side loops could be found on more rocky parts of the island. 
                    We also saw many groups of climbers practicing their skills on the cliffs alongside the ocean. This was a short, but completely worth it, detour after the Dragon’s back hike. 
                    It ended this day in a great manner!
                </p>

                <h2>Pros</h2>
                <p>
                    I highly recommend this hike for anyone who wants a nice introduction to hiking in Hong Kong, without previous walking experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the scenery is extremely beautiful with amazing viewpoints from the ridge and 360° lookouts over the coastal lines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, this trail is very well marked, making it impossible to get lost.
                </p>
                <h2 class="middle_title">Cons</h2>
                <p>
                    Since this path is one of the most popular in Hong Kong, it is also one of the most crowded, especially on weekends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you like to have a bit of a challenge when hiking, this is definitely not the right trail for you.
