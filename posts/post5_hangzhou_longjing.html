                <p>
                    With signs of spring showing up all around Shanghai, together with a few friends, we decided that it was time to go spend a full day immersed in nature. 
                    Temperatures were finally getting warmer and flowers were popping up all around the city. We could not wait to see what was happening in the countryside. 
                    Tea season being also right around the corner, we picked the Longjing tea fields as our playground for the day. 
                    We realized quite soon, when meeting at the train station, that we were not the only ones with this idea. 
                    Many people dressed in hiking clothes were gathering around the boarding gate of the different high-speed trains going to Hangzhou.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post5/big_pictures/post5_4big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post5/post5_4.jpg" alt="Longjing tea fields picture" class="landscape"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    After two hours spent on the way, we were finally at the starting point of the hike. We quickly found out that the trail we selected was very popular at this season. 
                    So, together with a few hundreds other people, we started our way towards the small village of Longjing. The path was fully paved and very easy to follow, going along a tiny river. 
                    Beautiful tea fields were surrounding the way on both sides. However, it was also extremely touristy, with coffee shops, restaurants, and fruits vendors showing up at regular intervals. 
                    We tried to find some side trails to get away from the crowd and walked a bit deeper into the tea plantations. Nonetheless, we could not really escape too far from the main road and were constantly nearby many other travellers.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post5/big_pictures/post5_6big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post5/post5_6.jpg" alt="Longjing tea fields picture" class="landscape"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    The first part of the hike, from Jiuxi new village to Longjing, could have been very enjoyable during low season, since the scenery was actually very remarkable. 
                    However, it was missing a bit of peace and quiet, at this time of the year, for us to feel fully satisfied. We still kept going until Longjing. 
                    The little hamlet was quite pleasant with nice looking houses and many small shops processing tealeaves. But, once again, people were everywhere.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post5/big_pictures/post5_8big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post5/post5_8.jpg" alt="Longjing tea fields picture" class="landscape"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    We continued to follow the GPS track that I had found on Liangbulu and headed towards the tea fields on the Northwest side of Longjing. Lunchtime approaching, our goal was to find a nice little space faraway from the tourists horde. 
                    This was when we decided to give up on our initial itinerary. The main path through the tea plantations was just completely packed and it didn’t look like it would change any time soon. 
                    We spotted a little side trail and decided to go check what it had to offer. This was the best decision we could have made!
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post5/big_pictures/post5_10big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post5/post5_10.jpg" alt="Longjing tea fields picture" class="landscape"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    As soon as we started to explore this new path, people just magically disappeared. We were finally alone in the middle of the tea terraces, meeting one or two local tea pickers here and there going back home for lunch. 
                    We found a nice little platform and had a very relaxing and peaceful picnic, enjoying the amazing landscape all around us.
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">
                    <a href="../images/posts/post5/big_pictures/post5_12big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/posts/post5/post5_12.jpg" alt="Longjing tea fields picture" class="landscape"></a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    After that, we could not resign ourselves to getting back on the main path. So, instead, we decided to keep going on this newly found trail, which was like heaven to us. 
                    The overall direction being more or less parallel to the original track we were following, we knew we could not get lost. 
                    We kept getting deeper into the plantations, finally completely alone in the great outdoor. The scenery was absolutely magical!
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    A little bit before reaching the top of the hill that we were climbing, the tea fields stopped, letting place to a nice forest. 
                    The path disappeared around that time and we had to cross through the bushes to go over the summit and get back on the main track. 
                    It was an interesting experience and we felt like wild women exploring new territories. We had a lot of fun!
                </p>

                <div class="pictures_post">

                </div>

                <p>
                    After that, we were back on the main path with all the people that we wanted to avoid so much. Not able to find another sidetrack, we kept going on this trail for a few hundred meters. 
                    At the first occasion, when finally finding an empty road, without any hesitation, we turned right and escaped the flock of travellers. This new path was taking us to Meijiawu village. 
                    It sounded great to us, as long as it meant that we could be alone again on the trail. It did not disappoint us!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once again, we were completely alone in the middle of the tea fields. The landscape was fully open and there were only tea terraces as far as we could see. 
                    We slowly made our way down to this unknown destination of Meijiawu, enjoying our time and taking in this fantastic scenery.

                <p>
                    After a few kilometers, we could see the little town appearing in the distance. Several teahouses were right at the border of the plantations. 
                    We decided that there was no better way to conclude this day than enjoying a nice cup of Longjing tea in this environment. And this was exactly what we did!

                <h2>Pros</h2>
                <p>
                    I highly recommend this hike for anyone who wants to experience this amazing landscape so typical of China: the tea fields. It is the perfect trail to bring all your friends and family coming to visit you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, since the tea plantations are so vast, it is possible to find less travelled paths. You can enjoy the scenery for yourselves, as long as you are willing to follow an unknown track. 
                    Being so close to Hangzhou, you can’t really get lost and will always be able to find a bus bringing you back to the city center.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, this trail is relatively easy and does not require much effort to hike.
                </p>
                <h2 class="middle_title">Cons</h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, this area around Longjing can be very crowded during high season and when the weather is nice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first part of the trail going from Jiuxi to Longjing is fairly touristic, with well-developed cement paths and lots of supporting infrastructures (coffe shops, restaurants...). 
                    You will not feel like you are really in the middle of nature, until you pass Longjing.
                </p>
