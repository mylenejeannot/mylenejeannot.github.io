Hello! My name is Mylene! I am the creator behind this little blog. I love spending time outside in nature and I am always looking for my next adventure, be it by foot or by bike. Being a true minimalist, I enjoy the simplicity and the freedom coming from exploring my surroundings with as little equipment as possible and a simple plan.
When I arrived in Shanghai, 8 years ago, I felt this big need to escape the city as often as possible to relax and find peace in the countryside. I feel the happiest when surrounded by trees, high in the mountains or relaxing by the beach, which is not exactly found easily in a huge megalopolis. I was spending my time researching about all the beautiful places China had to offer, but felt overwhelmed and a bit scared at the idea of going out there on my own. After all these years, I am finally fully comfortable in doing it! With The Minimalist Hiker, my goal is to share all the knowledge and experience I have gained by hiking in China. I want to introduce all the amazing places which are so close to us and all the tools that can be used to make the trip as easy as possible. Come and join me!
